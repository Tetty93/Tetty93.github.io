<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p> This recipe makes quick, <strong>tasty hummus</strong>, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that
    I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>
    <mark>Ingredients</mark>
</h2>

<p>
    <em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)<br>
        175g of tahini<br>
        6 sun-dried tomatoes<br>
        Half a red pepper <br>
        A pinch of cayenne pepper <br>
        1 clove of garlic <br>
        A dash of olive oil </em><br>
</p>

<!-- comments -->
<p><sub><del>Remove</del></sub> <u>the</u> skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
    <mark>Process all the ingredients</mark> into a paste.<br>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time<br>
    If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time<br>
</p>
<p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle,
    harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>
    <mark>Storage</mark>
</h2>

<p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made it.
    If it starts to become
    <del>fizzy</del>
    , you should definitely discard it.
</p>

    This is what Daniele Tortoli has to say about hummus:
<blockquote>I hate it!</blockquote>
<p><em><small>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</small></em></p>
<p><em><small>Always remember to drink H<sub>2</sub>O</small></em></p>
